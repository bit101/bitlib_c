bitlib graphics library ported to c (gtk/cairo).

So far only tested on Linux machines.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Requirements}\label{md_README_autotoc_md1}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily gtk3} dev libraries\+: {\ttfamily cairo}, {\ttfamily glib}, some others. Best just to install {\ttfamily gtk3}.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Debian / Ubuntu\+: {\ttfamily libgtk-\/3-\/dev}.
\item Arch\+: {\ttfamily gtk}
\item Manjaro\+: already has {\ttfamily gtk} installed.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily gcc} but works fine with {\ttfamily clang} as well.
\item {\ttfamily pkg-\/config}
\item {\ttfamily imagemagick} for gif creation
\item {\ttfamily ffmpeg} for video creation
\item {\ttfamily eog} for image viewing
\item {\ttfamily vlc} for video viewing
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Make}\label{md_README_autotoc_md2}
Run {\ttfamily make dist}\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item generates the {\ttfamily bitlib.\+a} library file into {\ttfamily libs} folder.
\item copies {\ttfamily libs} and {\ttfamily include} into {\ttfamily dist} folder.
\item zips dist into a ditribution zip file based on the verion defined in {\ttfamily makefile}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Run {\ttfamily make clean}\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item removes all build artifacts, including {\ttfamily libs}.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Scripts}\label{md_README_autotoc_md3}
Add or update the dist files to another project using the {\ttfamily copy\+\_\+dist.\+sh} script, passing the path of the other project. Example\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}./copy_dist.sh ../existing_project
\end{DoxyVerb}


Generate a new project with {\ttfamily new\+\_\+project.\+sh}. The project in {\ttfamily demo} itself is incomplete and will not run by itself. Use the {\ttfamily new\+\_\+project.\+sh} script to generate a runnable project elsewhere. Pass the path of the new project to the script. Example\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}./new_project.sh ../test
cd ../test
make
\end{DoxyVerb}
\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Use of template}\label{md_README_autotoc_md4}
In the new project, edit {\ttfamily sketch.\+c} to create your image or animation.

The {\ttfamily setup()} function lets you specify the output as image, gif or video. You can set render config values (size, frames, fps) for each of those.

Custom drawing code goes in the {\ttfamily render} function.

You can create multiple sketch files. To run a different one, open {\ttfamily makefile} and change the value of {\ttfamily S\+K\+E\+T\+C\+H\+\_\+C} at the top to point to the location of the sketch you want to compile.

There\textquotesingle{}s usually no need to touch the {\ttfamily main.\+c} file or the rest of {\ttfamily makefile}, but there are a couple of configuration items possible.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The renderer will use 4 threads by default when rendering animation frames. You can change {\ttfamily num\+\_\+threads} in {\ttfamily main.\+c} to increase or decrease that number at your own risk.
\item The renderer will spit out some console logs before, during and after the rendering process. This can interfere with any logging you might be doing in your own sketch files. You can set the environmental variable {\ttfamily B\+L\+\_\+\+Q\+U\+I\+ET} to {\ttfamily 1} to squelch this output. This can be set in the {\ttfamily makefile}.
